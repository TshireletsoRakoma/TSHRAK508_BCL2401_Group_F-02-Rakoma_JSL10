## Description
This JavaScript code provides a set of functionalities for solving different rooms based on user interaction with buttons on a webpage. It includes event listeners for buttons that trigger specific actions to navigate through rooms, process data from JSON files, and ultimately provide outcomes in the form of text content displayed on the webpage.

## Features
1. Room 1 Solution
When the button with the ID "solveRoom1" is clicked, the code fetches a list of books from books.json.
It then determines the most recent book based on the publication date.
The title of the most recent book is displayed as a clue to unlock the next room.
2. Room 2 Solution
When the button with the ID "solveRoom2" is clicked, the code creates sets of JavaScript and React concepts.
It finds the intersection of the two sets, identifying common concepts between JavaScript and React.
The common concepts are displayed as a code to unlock the next door.
3. Room 3 Solution
When the button with the ID "solveRoom3" is clicked, the code fetches directions from directions.json.
It navigates through the directions using an asynchronous function.
Upon successful navigation, a congratulatory message is displayed, signaling mastery of Vanilla JavaScript and readiness to explore React.
## Outcomes
For Room 1: The title of the most recent book is displayed as a clue to proceed.
For Room 2: The common concepts between JavaScript and React are displayed as a code to unlock the door.
For Room 3: A message of success is displayed after navigating through the directions, signaling progress in JavaScript and readiness for React.
How to Use
## Setup:
Ensure that the HTML page includes buttons with the IDs "solveRoom1", "solveRoom2", and "solveRoom3".
The HTML page should also have elements with the IDs "room1Result", "room2Result", and "room3Result" to display the outcomes.
Make sure books.json and directions.json files are accessible in the same directory as the script.
Running the Script:
Open the HTML page in a web browser.
Click the buttons "solveRoom1", "solveRoom2", and "solveRoom3" as needed to trigger the respective room solutions.
## Note
The script assumes that the HTML page is properly structured with the necessary elements and that books.json and directions.json are available in the expected location.
Check the console for potential error messages if outcomes do not display as expected.
